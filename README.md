# NDEF4j

A pure java library for creating NDEF records, if you're not developing for Android.

### Currently supported:
- Text Records
- URL Records (http:// and https:// only)


### Using in your project
it's not fully ready yet so i'll probably put it on maven central sooner or later. for now, you'll need to clone the 
repository and build the jar yourself with ``mvn package`` and import that into your project.
